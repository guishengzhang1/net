abstract: Object recognition in real-world environments is one of the fundamental and key tasks in computer vision and robotics communities. With the advanced sensing technologies and low-cost depth sensors, the high-quality RGB and depth images can be recorded synchronously, and the object recognition performance can be improved by jointly exploiting them. RGB-D-based object recognition has evolved from early methods that using hand-crafted representations to the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods. With the undeniable success of deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the visual domain, the natural progression of deep learning research points to problems involving larger and more complex multimodal data. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent multimodal CNNs (MMCNNs)-based approaches that have demonstrated significant â€¦
