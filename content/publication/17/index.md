abstract: Abnormal crowd behavior detection is an advanced topic researched in fields of computer vision and digital image processing. The problems such as diversity of monitoring scene, different crowd density and mutual occlusion among crowds etc result in a low recognition rate for abnormal crowd behavior detection. In order to solve these problems, this paper combines a streakline model based on fluid dynamics with an abnormal behavior detection method presented by Hassner et al., and proposes a modified algorithm to improve the recognition accuracy of abnormal crowd behavior. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the algorithm are verified via a large amount of challenging real-world surveillance videos.
