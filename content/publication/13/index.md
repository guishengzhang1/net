abstract: Inductive energy storage for pulsed power supplies is considered to have great potential because its energy density is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of capacitive one. Associating with the superconducting technology and the STRETCH meat grinder circuit, which proposed by the Institute of Advanced Technology, a superconducting inductive pulsed power supply (SPPS) circuit has been proposed by using an air-core high-temperature superconducting pulsed power transformer (HTSPPT) in our previous study. It can not only recapture the energy in the leakage flux and slow down the current change in inductors by using a capacitor, but also reduce the coil loss and the power requirement of the primary source by using superconducting inductors. However, it can be found that the SPPS may generate a large residual current during the discharging phase, which results in an adverse influence on the working...
