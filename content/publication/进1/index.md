abstract: High efficiency video coding (HEVC) has achieved high coding efficiency as the video coding standard. For rate control in HEVC, the conventional R-λ scheme is based on mean absolute difference in allocating bits; however, the scheme does not fully utilize the perceptual importance variation to guide rate control, thus the subjective and objective quality of coded videos has room to improve. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a rate control scheme that considers perceptual importance. We first develop a perceptual importance analysis scheme to accurately abstract the spatial and temporal perceptual importance maps of video contents. The results of the analysis are then used to guide the bit allocation. Utilizing this model, a region-level bit allocation procedure is developed to maintain video quality balance. Subsequently, a largest coding unit (LCU)-level bit allocation scheme is designed to obtain the target bit …
