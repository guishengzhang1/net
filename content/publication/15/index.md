abstract: For electromagnetic emission applications that need a very high amplitude and an appropriate pulsewidth, a pulsed power supply based on multiple high-temperature superconducting pulsed power transformer (HTSPPT) modules is verified in this paper. First, the working processes of multiple HTSPPT modules are analyzed and two small experimental HTSPPTs are described in detail. Then, simulation is carried out to show the major pulse characteristics of two different discharge methods. To verify the feasibility of two discharge methods, high-current testing is carried out with the two HTSPPTs. The results show that a higher amplitude of current pulse can be achieved using synchronous parallel discharge and a larger pulsewidth of current pulse can be achieved using asynchronous parallel discharge.
